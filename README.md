# Trajectory Descriptor Fields
We propose a novel application of [Neural Descriptor Fields](https://github.com/anthonysimeonov/ndf_robot) for learning object manipulation trajectories from demonstrations. We extend the original work to apply to entire trajectories, via energy function integration combined with optimizing the trajectory.
